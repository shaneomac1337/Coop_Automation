Okay - so I am automating a solution to properly import a configuration to our store manager application.

I have already prepared a example import file which I have prepared in the past but it was for different customer so we should just use it as a knowledge base.

Please take a look on a structure installation test store and also the GKStores config
GKStoresconfig is the example i have used for another customer.

For this customer, we will have the basee import file from the Structure installation test - it's little bit more simple now without HybridInfoservers

But similarily as we did for the GKStores we will have to modify the WDM configuration.

that's the similar operation as this:

				
				

In our case we will be changing the wall configs for wdm
wall-config.walls.1.clientId= there will be an ip address
there will be maximum of 
wall-config.walls.1.clientId={ip_address}
wall-config.walls.2.clientId={ip_address}
wall-config.walls.3.clientId={ip_address}
wall-config.walls.100.clientId={ip_address}

and all of those walls should get the IP address
The ip address we will be getting from external source file, but I still did not have an example, so we can maybe also build it

We will have to use some mapping because there will be multiple stores like 9999, 1674, 1655
my example for import i provided with 9999
